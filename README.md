PinkBubbles.Informa Web App
===========================

Simplified client for FAQ database of Spanish Tax Authority. The app is only in Spanish, sorry.

The following technologies are being used:
* ASP.Net Web API
* [FunScript](http://funscript.info/) (with FunScript.HTML extensions): F# to JavaScript compiler
* [Ractive.js](http://www.ractivejs.org/): JavaScript MVC Library
* [Foundation for Apps Alpha](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps): CSS Framework (uses flexbox so it's not compatible with old browsers)

You can find the app alive here: [pinkbubbles.azurewebsites.net](pinkbubbles.azurewebsites.net)
